Ain't this the program that is gonna read a bunch of ruby files 
and extract from the horrible code you make
all the TODO's (that you forget the next minute you wrote), according that follow one of these syntaxes:
- # Comment here
- <!-- Comment here -->
And maybe - =begin Comment here =end

So running the script will give you something like:
Todo's for app/controller/controller_name:
-Some todo text

Todo's for app/views/view_name:
-Some todo text
